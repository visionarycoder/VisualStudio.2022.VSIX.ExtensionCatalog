# Extension Catalog

An extension for extension management.

## Description

I work on multiple computers during my day.  Client supplied laptop, work laptop, my primary laptop, and various PCs scattered around my house.  Visual Studio is my primary development environment.  As you can image, managing all of the extensions I have installed across these machines can be a challenge.  So here we are.

## Requirements

- I want to know what extensions are installed in a given instance of Visual Studio on a machine.  
- I want to keep and track my "stock" list of extensions.  
- I want to add extensions from my "stock" list to an instance of Visual Studio without drama.

## Target

Visual Studio 2022

## Notes

### Folder location

C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<Instance Id>\Extensions
